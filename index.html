                            We curate a comprehensive dataset of 4,550 questions and solutions from problem sets, 
                            midterm exams, and final exams across all MIT Mathematics and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) courses 
                            required for obtaining a degree. We evaluate the ability of large language models to fulfill the graduation requirements 
                            for any MIT major in Mathematics and EECS. GPT-3.5, upon release as ChatGPT, successfully solved a third of the MIT curriculum based 
                            on human evaluation. We employ GPT-4 to grade responses given ground truth solutions for scalable automatic evaluation 
                            across different models and methods, with a detailed performance breakdown by course, question, and answer type. 
                            We find that the accuracy of automatic GPT-4 grading is above 90% for long-form answers and near 100% for multiple-choice questions, 
                            based on human evaluation. Using this GPT-4 automatic grading metric on a random test set excluding questions based on 
                            images we find that GPT-3.5-turbo-16k passes with 56% and GPT-4-0613 receives an A grade of 90% using a generic expert as the GPT-4 system role. 
                            Further improvement by prompt engineering, while ensuring no information leakage of the solution or whether a question is correct, 
                            results in GPT-4-0613 acing the MIT test set. We fine-tune open-source large language models on this dataset to find that 
                            these models improve performance. By embedding questions in a low-dimensional space, we qualitatively explore the 
                            relationships between questions, topics, and classes and discover which questions and classes are required for solving 
                            other questions and classes through few-shot learning. Our analysis offers valuable insights into course prerequisites 
                            and curriculum design, highlighting language models' potential for learning and improving Mathematics and EECS education. 
                            In the spirit of reproducible research, we make our code publicly available.

                                Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to pass exams from individual
                                college-level courses. However, a systematic evaluation of this ability across
                                entire curricula thatstudents would be expected to go through to obtain their college
                                degrees has not been explored before due to the lack of a central repository of
                                questions from actual exams and assignments at the curriculum-level. In this paper, we
                                introduce MIT-Courses, a curated dataset of 4,550 questions and their solutions spanning
                                exams and assignments from all courses that are part of the curriculum for the
                                Mathematics and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) majors at MIT. The
                                dataset is seven times larger than our previously released dataset and covers all
                                the course requirements for an undergraduate degree.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Using this dataset, we benchmark four state-of-the-art language models, GPT-4,
                                GPT-3.5, StableVicuna, and LLaMA, which vary in their sizes, their
                                capabilities, and whether their weights are publicly available or not. We evaluate
                                different LLM prompting techniques (few-shot, chain of thought, self-critique) and document their effect on the model success rates. We propose a
                                new prompting technique which we call expert prompting, where we ask the model to
                                suggest named experts on a given question, then ask for the answer the named experts
                                would have given and subsequently make a collective decision. Our experiments show that
                                expert prompting further improves performance relative to prior prompt engineering
                                techniques. For models whose weights are publicly available, we also experiment with how
                                fine-tuning improves performance on our test set as well as other reasoning tasks.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                In addition to providing performance measures across various models, we demonstrate the
                                application of our models for curriculum design for college majors. An essential aspect
                                of curriculum design is determining the appropriate sequence of courses to ensure
                                prerequisites are established effectively. Traditionally, this process is manual,
                                relying on human input to identify key concepts and learning outcomes. However, this
                                method is subjective, and coordinating input from various faculty members teaching
                                different courses can be challenging. Instead, we use the embeddings for the questions
                                of different courses to discover dependencies between courses. Given the challenges of
                                accurate student evaluation in a world where large language models are readily
                                available, we also propose the development of new meta-questions that focus on assessing
                                the correctness and completeness of students' understanding rather than their ability to
                                generate correct answers.

                                solutions from 30 MIT Mathematics and EECS courses required to graduate from the
                                institute. This includes a broad range of core and elective courses, providing students

                                We propose several heuristics for optimizing the prompt W that maximizes the expected grade over the
                                dataset D. Let W be the context of words, Q be the question, A be the LLM answer, and S
                                be the ground truth solution, D a dataset of {Q, S} pairs, 𝔼 the expectation over the questions and solutions in the dataset, 
                                f the LLM, and g an automatic grading process. Our goal is to optimize:

                                were written by the experts, and finally to combine the experts answers by collaborative
                                decision making. This process is represented by using a generic expert defined as the
                                system role such as:
                                <br />

                                We fine-tune an open-source model using our dataset and then make the fine-tuned model available to the public. We divide the dataset into separate training and test sets to ensure a fair evaluation. We benchmark the open-source LLM by comparing its performance on the test set before and after fine-tuning. We compare the performance of the fine tuned model not only on our dataset test set but also on another dataset, ReClor demonstrating improved mathematical reasoning ability. Providing a fine-tuned model allows us to maintain the integrity of the dataset while still providing valuable resources to the research community.

                                We embed all course questions into 1536-dimensional vectors using OpenAI's
                                text-embedding-ada-002. The embedded text consists of the topic of the question
                                concatenated with the question itself. This embedding performs well on sentence
                                similarity, can process long course questions, and is computationally efficient,
                                embedding all course questions in five minutes. By analyzing the similarity between
                                question embeddings from the same and different courses, we can make curriculum
                                decisions. For example, a dependency graph of prerequisite classes is inferred in which
                                the graph nodes are classes. The directed edges between two nodes measure the ability to
                                answer questions from one class by questions from another by few-shot learning.

                                We apply few-shot, chain-of-thought, self-critique, and expert prompting as a cascade. 
                                Since grading is performed automatically, we apply each method to the questions that 
                                the previous methods do not solve perfectly. From the dataset of MIT questions, 
                                a test set of 288 questions is randomly selected amongst questions without images and with solutions. 
                                First, zero-shot answers to these questions are generated by the LLMs. 
                                These answers are then graded on a scale from 0 to 5 by GPT-4.
                                OpenAI evals also measure correctness using automatic GPT-4 grading.
                                We double-verify manually that the grading of the test set is correct.
                                Then, for all questions without a perfect score, few-shot answers from GPT-4 using the top 3 most similar questions 
                                under the embedding are generated. These answers are again graded by GPT-4 from 0 to 5. 
                                Then, few-shot and chain-of-thought are applied to questions not receiving a 5 out of 5 in the previous answers. 
                                Subsequently, self-critique is applied to the remaining questions. Finally, once grading on these answers is completed 
                                across all experts, all questions are solved correctly.
                                A similar process is performed for the ReClor validation set consisting of 500 questions.

                                engineering as an optimization problem and provide effective sample heuristics. Our
                                evaluation
                                demonstrates that GPT-4, combined with a system expert, few-shot learning,
                                chain-of-thought, self-
                                critique, and collaborative decision-making techniques, achieves a perfect solve rate on
                                a randomly
                                selected test set of these questions, that are not available online, and excluding image-based questions. We release a LLaMA
                                model
                                fine-tuned on the MIT curriculum, which improves performance on a benchmark for
                                assessing
                                logical reasoning abilities. By employing few-shot learning, or in-context learning, we
                                determine
                                which questions and courses should be prerequisites for other courses based on the data,
                                thereby
                                identifying the foundational content necessary for advanced topics. Instead of
                                prohibiting using LLMs
                                in the classroom, we advocate for their integration by designing meta-questions that
                                incorporate
                                LLM-generated answers, requiring students to evaluate the completion and correctness of
                                these
                                responses.

                                Limitations of our work is that inference and automatic grading using GPT-4 is
                                relatively slow, taking
                                around a minute for each question, and has a limited context window.

                                Using a dataset of problem sets, midterms, and final exam questions and answers, we
                                identify course
                                connections and propose an optimal sequence of prerequisites. This approach assists
                                educators and
                                academic administrators to evaluate, design, and enhance curricula. In the future, such
                                tools may
                                prove invaluable for introducing new course content, identifying gaps in a curriculum,
                                pinpointing
                                courses with weak connections to others, and reinforcing key concepts. This method could
                                benefit
                                residential and asynchronous learners, helping students make informed decisions about
                                course
                                selection and guiding professors in determining which content to teach.
